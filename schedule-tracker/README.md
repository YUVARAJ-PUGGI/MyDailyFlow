## 🌟 Why MyDailyFlow?

Engineering life is chaotic. Between **DSA practice, system design studies, university exams, and personal projects**, it's easy to lose track of time—and your motivation.

**MyDailyFlow** solves this by turning your daily schedule into a **game**. It's not just a to-do list; it's a "productivity operating system" that rewards you for consistent deep work.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. 📅 Plan Intelligently
Input your day in seconds. MyDailyFlow uses **smart collision detection** to warn you if your coding blocks overlap with your classes. Overdue tasks? One click **auto-reschedules** them to the next available slot.

### 2. 🍅 Deep Focus Mode
Activate the built-in **Focus Timer** to enter a flow state. Whether it's a 2-hour LeetCode session or a 45-minute exam revision, the distraction-free interface keeps you locked in.

### 3. 🎮 Level Up Your Life
Every completed task earns you **XP (Experience Points)**.
*   **Earn XP**: Complete tasks, maintain streaks, and finish focus sessions.
*   **Level Up**: Watch your profile level grow as you become more consistent.
*   **Unlock Rewards**: Spend your hard-earned XP in the **Theme Shop** to unlock premium, "glassmorphism" UI themes.

### 4. 📊 Visualize Your Growth
Don't just work hard—work smart. Our **Analytics Dashboard** tracks:
*   **Study Streaks**: Never break the chain.
*   **Focus Distribution**: See exactly how much time you spent on "Coding" vs "Academics".
*   **Consistency**: Heatmaps that look just like your GitHub contributions.

## ✨ Start Your Streak Today

**MyDailyFlow** is more than an app. It's the discipline you need, packaged in the interface you deserve.
